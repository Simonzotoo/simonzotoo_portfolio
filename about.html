<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I’m Simon Zotoo  a developer, data analyst, and student leader. I’m currently pursuing a BSc in Information Technology at Wisconsin International University College, Ghana, where I also serve as the SCOTSA President.
</p>
<p>
  I love building things that make life easier  from banking systems in Java to management tools in PHP, and dashboards in Power BI. I’m not just learning to code  I’m learning to solve real problems.
</p>
<p>
  I’ve worked with the SSNIT Head Office as a database intern, managed student performance tools, and built apps like a birthday reminder system that actually remembers your friends better than you do.
</p>
<p>
  Outside of tech? I play piano at church. I lead when it counts. And I believe in always showing up with purpose.
